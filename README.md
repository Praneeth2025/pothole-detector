# Obstacle Detection Using AI


This project is designed for a website named Obstacle, which focuses on identifying and sharing road hazards such as potholes and manholes. The website allows users to upload photos of obstacles along with their exact locations, enabling others to be aware of and avoid these hazards in advance.

To enhance this process, an AI model was developed to automatically detect and classify the type of obstacle (pothole or manhole) from the uploaded images. This ensures accurate and timely updates for future users, making road navigation safer and more efficient.

   To achieve this, we started with a dataset of 50 pothole images and 25 manhole images. Using data augmentation techniques such as flipping, blurring, rotating, and adjusting image brightness, we expanded the dataset significantly. As a result, we successfully generated 300 images for each category—potholes and manholes—ensuring a balanced and robust dataset for training the AI model.
